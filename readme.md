# Deep Q-Learning with a Multilayer Neural Network

## Description
DQN algorithm to automatically learn to play OpenAI's Gym game **LunarLander-v2** [Game page](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2)

The traditional approach to approximating the Q function by creating a table and progressively updating the weights is
unfeasible for significantly large state spaces. We use an alternative approach of trying to approximate the Q function
by using a Neural Network.
